## To get the most out of this book
This book is for anyone who is interested in the field of Algorithmic Trading. 
You are not expected to have any background in finance or algorithmic trading. 
You are expected to have a basic knowledge of the Python programming language. 
Each chapter introduces a new concept in Algorithmic Trading and takes you 
step-by-step from zero to hero. This book can help you build a rock-solid 
foundation in Algorithmic Trading using Python. 

You need to have the latest version of Python 3 installed on your computer. 
The recipes of this Chapter were tested on Python 3.8.2. They should work on any 
future release of Python as well. 

You also need a broking account with Zerodha, a modern broker, to try out the 
recipes for most of the chapters. Appendix I gives detailed step-by-step 
information to set up your Zerodha account in case you do not have it. 

For executing trading strategies, you also need an account with AlgoBulls. 
Appendix II gives detailed step-by-step information to set up your AlgoBulls 
account in case you do not have it.

Also, almost every chapter expects you to have additional Python 
packages installed like ‘pyalgotrading'. You can install them using `pip`. 
This is explained in the technical requirements section of every chapter.
All the recipes in this chapter are provided as Jupyter Notebooks ih this 
GitHub repository. You can install Jupyter Notebook as well if you would 
like to try out the recipes directly without typing any code. 
You can install this using pip - `pip install notebook`.
